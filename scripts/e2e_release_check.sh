# End-to-end release check — the product, not the code.
#
# The test suite runs against the source tree with the developer's own
# environment around it. This runs against the artifact a user installs, on a
# machine that has never seen markitai, and drives only the public CLI. That
# gap is where the interesting failures live: a flag that silently does
# nothing without a config file, a resume that cannot resume, an install hint
# naming a command that does not work — none of which a unit test sees.
#
# It uses a real LLM and therefore costs real money (a few cents at the
# default model and batch size).
#
#   scripts/e2e_release_check.sh
#
# What it drives, in order: the first help screen, doctor on a bare machine,
# zero-config conversion, the three LLM routes (key, MODEL, --alt/--desc), a
# local web page, a directory batch with cost reporting, interrupt + resume,
# the cache, the failure messages, every documented input format, presets and
# output profiles, the flags that change a run's shape, the refusals (removed
# aliases, private URLs offered to remote services, Batch API on the wrong
# pool), a .urls list, the three configuration layers plus the cache
# commands, the Python API, then — with the serve/mcp/legacy extras added to
# the same install — doctor again, legacy Office formats, the serve API the
# browser UI talks to, and markitai-mcp over stdio; then, with browser,
# and extra-fetch added too, Chromium via doctor --fix, Playwright
# rendering, URL screenshots and screenshot-only reading, the Cloudflare
# file backend, the remote extraction strategies on
# a public page (including Fake-IP VPN resolution), and a real Batch API
# job through submit, hand-off and collect.
#
# It writes a report you can open — WORKDIR/report.html — with one numbered
# directory per step beside it holding that step's inputs, outputs and logs.
#
# Configuration — every variable can be overridden from the environment:
#
#   CLEANUP_ON_SUCCESS=1   remove WORKDIR when every check passed
#                          (default 0: the artifacts and the report are the
#                          point of running this by hand)
#   WORKDIR=/tmp/...       where the report, the artifacts and the throwaway
#                          home go (default /tmp/markitai-e2e)
#   ENV_FILE=~/.markitai/.env    where provider keys are read from
#   E2E_MODEL=provider/model     pinned model for the deterministic checks
#   E2E_PYTHON=/path/to/python   interpreter for the throwaway install
#                          (default: the repo's own venv interpreter)
#   BATCH_DOCS=40          documents generated for the batch/interrupt steps
#   HTTP_PORT=8899         port for the local page used by the URL steps
#   SERVE_PORT=8900        port for the web workspace step
#   E2E_PUBLIC_URL=https://...   public page for the remote-strategy step
#   E2E_BATCH_MODEL=openai/...   single-model pool for the Batch API step
#   BATCH_WAIT=600         seconds to keep collecting a Batch API job that
#                          outlasted its 120s submit wait
#   PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=...  where Chromium lives (default: the real
#                          home's Playwright cache, so runs share one download;
#                          point it at an empty dir to test the cold path)
#   INTERRUPT_AFTER=6      seconds to let the batch run before interrupting it
#                          (the step shortens the state flush interval so this
#                          does not have to outlast the 10s default)
#   SKIP_INTERRUPT=1       skip the interrupt/resume step entirely
#
# Exit status: 0 when every check passed, 1 otherwise.

<h1>Quarterly Report</h1>
<p>Revenue grew 14% quarter over quarter, driven by the new pipeline and by a
steadier renewal rate among mid-market accounts. Gross margin held flat while
headcount grew, which is the outcome the plan called for.</p>
<h2>Regional detail</h2>
<p>Region B carried the quarter. Its growth came almost entirely from expansion
inside existing accounts rather than new logos, so the pipeline metrics below
understate how much of the number was already contracted at the start of the
period.</p>
<ul><li>Region A: +9%, in line with plan</li>
<li>Region B: +22%, ahead of plan on expansion</li>
<li>Region C: +3%, behind plan on a delayed launch</li></ul>
<table><tr><th>Region</th><th>Growth</th><th>Plan</th></tr>
<tr><td>A</td><td>9%</td><td>15%</td></tr>
<tr><td>B</td><td>22%</td><td>15%</td></tr></table>
<h2>What we are watching</h2>
<p>Two risks carry into next quarter. The delayed launch in Region C moves
roughly a third of its pipeline into the following period, and the renewal
cohort concentrates in the last three weeks of the quarter, which leaves very
little room to recover a miss.</p>
