# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.1.0] - 2026-09-14

- **About 6× faster overall**: URLs **5.8×**, Office/PDF **5.6×**, batch conversion **6.6×** in equally weighted local benchmarks, excluding LLM, OCR and internet latency.
- **Faster results**: reduce startup and repeated parsing; avoid unnecessary browser fallback for complete short articles and CJK prose.
- **Preserve output quality**: retain compatible handling of text, metadata, equations and images, with established fallbacks for complex documents.
- **Fix public URL detection**: Defuddle and other remote readers work behind Fake-IP proxies such as Clash while private-address protections remain in place.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-09-10

### Added

- `--json` conversion results with per-item status, output, usage, cost and run-level errors; requires `-o` and excludes `--dry-run` / `--llm-batch-collect`.
- `--no-remote-fetch` to disable remote URL extraction and `--log-level` to control configured file logging.
- MCP output profiles and bounded batch concurrency (default 10); omitted `llm` now follows server configuration.
- Bilingual website comparison pages, search/social metadata, and documentation and UI checks in CI.

### Changed

- Serve sign-in URLs use `#token=`; config list/get/set redact secrets, including nested request headers, unless `--show-secrets` is explicit.
- Web workspace adds upload progress/cancel, row downloads, clearer options and errors, improved accessibility, and settings/preview loading on demand. Removes Tailwind and unused UI code.
- CLI progress goes to stderr; help and errors clarify output paths, supported formats, optional dependencies and removed flags.

### Fixed

- Prevent same-name MCP outputs from overwriting each other and stale LLM files from appearing in API results.
- Preserve job options across retries/restarts, prevent premature completion and restored ghost rows, and isolate concurrent ZIP downloads.
- Validate and pin public destinations through redirects and browser subrequests for anonymous remote jobs; isolate their fetch caches and browser sessions.
- Limit Batch enhancement to the current run and report final artifacts, usage and failures correctly. Preserve RAG/Obsidian images, wikilinks and alt text through Batch processing and history.
- Handle malformed configuration, cache replacement limits, empty URL lists and error exit codes consistently; align release checks with fragment-based sign-in URLs.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-09-09

### Added

- **markitai is now a library as well as a CLI**: `markitai.convert("report.pdf")` and its async twin `aconvert` return a typed `ConversionOutput` — markdown, frontmatter, asset and screenshot paths, per-image analysis and usage totals — reusing the CLI's own configuration layering. Provisional: signatures and result fields may still change
- **`markitai mcp` starts the bundled MCP server from the CLI**, the form the official MCP Registry entry (`io.github.Ynewtime/markitai`) uses: `uvx --from "markitai[mcp]" markitai mcp`
- **MCP agents get markitai through the `mcp` extra**: `markitai.mcp` ships in the main wheel and exposes `convert_document`, `convert_url`, `batch_convert` and `job_status` over stdio. `claude mcp add markitai -- uvx --from "markitai[mcp]" markitai-mcp`
- **`--profile rag|obsidian|okf` shapes the output for its consumer**: `rag` moves images into a visible `assets/` (hidden paths are skipped by ingestors like LlamaIndex's `SimpleDirectoryReader`) and rewrites PDF page markers; `obsidian` adds optional wikilinks; `okf` maps frontmatter to the Open Knowledge Format. Orthogonal to `--preset`; without it the output is byte-identical
- **`--llm-batch` runs a directory's LLM stage at half price** through the provider's Batch API on a single-model OpenAI or Anthropic pool, waiting up to `--llm-batch-timeout` (1h) before handing off to `--llm-batch-collect`
- **`--llm-batch` covers image analysis and page screenshots**: `--alt`/`--desc` and `--screenshot` ride the same job at the same discount. A document with more pages than fit one call is enhanced live instead, since each extra batch round is a separate wait
- **The web UI can choose an output profile**, beside Preset and deliberately not hidden with the LLM switches — a profile shapes output rather than enhancement, so a plain local conversion can carry one
- **Three circuit breakers bounding one document's cost**: `llm.max_requests_per_document` (default 50) caps retry multiplication; `llm.max_vision_pages_per_document` is checked before anything is sent, so an oversized document costs nothing; `llm.max_cost_per_document_usd` is charged after each answer, bounding what a document goes on to spend. A trip skips the rest of that document's enhancement and keeps the unenhanced output. The two cost caps default to off
- **Legacy `.doc`/`.ppt` conversion through `markitai[legacy]`**: the bundled-Rust anydoc backend handles Office 97-2003 in milliseconds, with no Microsoft Office or LibreOffice on any platform
- **`--ocr --llm` is now named, measured and gated**: that combination sends page images to a vision model rather than running RapidOCR, which nothing used to say. Help, `doctor` and both CLI guides now call it VLM-OCR, metadata records which path ran, and `MARKITAI_NO_VLM_OCR=1` forbids it outright
- **Long page screenshots are tiled instead of shrunk**: a page taller than `screenshot.tile_height` (2000px) splits into full-width tiles rather than being downscaled into one unreadable strip
- **Mathematics comes back as LaTeX**: the prompts ask for `$...$` / `$$...$$` at every stage that sees a formula, where pymupdf hands display equations over as images and mangles inline math into markdown noise
- **CLI conversions can opt into the web UI history** with `--record-history` (or `MARKITAI_RECORD_HISTORY`, or `history.record`), recording a completed run as a job under `~/.markitai/serve/jobs/`
- **Conversion quality is now measured, three ways**: a snapshot guardrail freezes default output for a PDF/DOCX/PPTX/XLSX fixture set, an opt-in A/B harness compares prompt and model changes, and the webextract parity corpus scores HTML extraction against defuddle
- **The serve API contract is machine-checked**: every JSON route declares a pydantic response model, `scripts/export_openapi.py` exports the schema with SSE payloads injected, and a test holds `webapp/src/api/types.ts` to it
- **The defuddle port has a manifest and an upstream watch**: `PORT_MANIFEST.md` records which upstream sources each `webextract` module tracks and the commit the parity corpus pins, with a test keeping the two equal
- **The website serves `/llms.txt`**, and the README carries a comparison table against markitdown, docling and anydoc that states what each does better
- **`NOTICE` records the third-party obligations** MIT alone cannot cover: the AGPL-3.0 PyMuPDF stack and what it means for redistribution and network use, the defuddle port (MIT © kepano) behind `webextract/`, and the marker-derived benchmark scorer
- **CI fails on a non-commercial or unexpected copyleft dependency**: `scripts/check_licenses.py` reads licence metadata from a no-extras install and rejects anything non-commercial or proprietary, plus any AGPL/GPL package outside an explicit allowlist
- **Substack article extraction** now handles rendered bodies and `window._preloads` JSON, including custom domains and byline dates, while retaining Notes extraction and generic fallback.
- **Linux desktop proxy discovery** reads manual GNOME/Unity and KDE HTTP proxy settings and bypass lists. Explicit environment proxies still take precedence; PAC, SOCKS-only and authenticated desktop settings are not imported.
- **Opt-in benchmark LLM scoring** provides validated content, structure and noise scores through `score_with_llm_judge`, with offline cache reuse, input limits and no automatic retries. A cache miss requires an explicit model and `allow_network=True`; default benchmarks remain heuristic and offline.
- **Eight more formats convert without an extra**: `.tsv`, `.xml`, `.rst`, `.org`, `.tex`, `.odt`, `.ods` and `.rtf` now convert in the base wheel with the standard library alone — a tab-separated file is a Markdown table, and an OpenDocument file is a zip of XML
- **`.rtf` has a real native reader**: a tokenizer for groups, control words and `\'xx` bytes drives a group-scoped formatting state, so outline levels and stylesheet names become headings, `\trowd`/`\cell`/`\row` becomes a Markdown table, Word 97 `\pntext` glyphs and newer `\ls`/`\ilvl` lists keep their bullets and nesting, `HYPERLINK` fields become links, and `\ansicpg`/`\fcharset` decode CJK and Windows codepages — no extra, no extraction engine
- **Every boolean CLI flag has a spelled-out negation**: `--cache`, `--compress`, `--no-pure` and `--no-screenshot-only` join their siblings, so a config default can be overridden in either direction from the command line

### Changed

- **The three LLM routing surfaces merged into one `MarkitaiRouter`**: local providers dispatch through their handler table and standard models go back to litellm's own group balancing, cooldowns and fallbacks instead of a hand-rolled reimplementation
- **Structured LLM calls use the strongest mode a model actually supports**: native tool calling, then `response_format` JSON schema — which also switches on the claude-agent provider's until-now-unused native path — with markdown-JSON demoted to a last resort
- **One URL pipeline behind all four entry points**: `serve`, the Python API, `markitai <url>` and URL batches wrapped near-identical copies of fetch → localize → enhance → write, and now share one cascade in `workflow/url.py`
- **Prompt caching actually engages**: five system templates had their per-request variables near the top, leaving a stable prefix too short for any provider's cache to match. The variable segments moved to the tail; instruction text is unchanged
- **Converting a `.txt` no longer loads a PDF and Office toolchain**: converters registered eagerly, costing ~430ms per process and pulling in markitdown, Magika and onnxruntime regardless of input
- **A provider is described in one table, not five**: its default model and API-key variable had been hand-copied across credential detection, the setup wizard, `serve`'s startup candidates and `init`, and had drifted
- **Retirement warnings and cost estimates are derived, not transcribed**: the replacement model now comes from the defaults table and the retirement date from litellm's own record, replacing a stale literal and one hardcoded date stamped on every model
- **Self-explanatory errors no longer leak exception class names**: a missing OCR backend, an oversized file or an unsupported format prints the actionable message alone
- **The parity corpus is pinned to the same upstream as the algorithm**: fixtures resynced from a March 2026 snapshot to defuddle 0.19.3 (83 → 208), after porting the six upstream behaviours the new corpus exposed as missing
- **webextract parses and copies less**: one lxml path for fragments and documents, five copies of the block-tag table converged, no whole-tree deep copy per retry attempt, and one `srcset` implementation
- **A default install is 155 MB smaller** — 633 MB down to 477 MB. `opencv-python` left the core entirely and RapidOCR moved behind a new `ocr` extra. **Scanned-document and image OCR now needs `uv tool install "markitai[ocr]" --force`**
- **Images come out better without OpenCV**: Pillow alone beat it on every sample measured — higher PSNR and SSIM, 7.7% smaller files — because OpenCV's `INTER_LANCZOS4` downscale skips anti-alias prefiltering
- **Every dependency moved to its current release**, `litellm` 1.91.1 → 1.97.0 and `markitdown` 0.1.6 → 0.1.7 among 56 updates, with the licence audit re-run against the upgraded tree
- **The PDF engine floor moved to `pymupdf4llm>=1.28.2`**: 1.28.0 pulled in `pymupdf-layout` under a Polyform Noncommercial licence, which forbids commercial use outright; 1.28.2 restored AGPL-3.0 dual licensing
- **Setup no longer asks about LibreOffice**: slide rendering is an opt-in runtime path that a local MS Office already covers on Windows and macOS, so the guided installer leaves it out; a PPTX `--screenshot`/`--ocr` conversion with no renderer available warns at conversion time and names the per-OS install command
- **`--no-pure` beats `MARKITAI_PURE`**: an explicit flag on the command line now overrides the environment variable in both directions, where the env var previously won

### Removed

- **The three-platform Office automation is gone** — about 1.3k lines of Windows COM, macOS AppleScript and LibreOffice CLI driving, plus the batch pre-conversion machinery around it. `markitai[legacy]` covers the formats it existed for, and the LibreOffice hints now speak only about PPTX slide rendering
- **The `kreuzberg` extra and the `-b kreuzberg` backend are gone**: every format it covered now converts natively, so the extra had nothing left to unlock. `--backend` is `native|cloudflare`, the `fetch.kreuzberg_convert_enabled` setting is dropped, and `--kreuzberg` is a usage error that says `.rtf` converts natively rather than naming a replacement
- **The six deprecated fetch and backend flag aliases are gone** (`--playwright`, `--defuddle`, `--static`, `--jina`, `--cloudflare`, `--kreuzberg`) in favour of `-s` and `-b`. A removed name is now a usage error naming its replacement, and `--help` drops from 36 options to 30
- **Two redundant defence layers inside the LLM path**: a hand-rolled JSON-mode strategy sitting below a structured ladder that already does the same repair, and a hand-maintained Copilot price table live traffic had stopped reaching
- **The `llm.prompts.page_content_system` and `llm.prompts.page_content_user` settings**, with the code path they configured: both modes their docstring claimed had long since routed elsewhere, so setting either did nothing
- **FFmpeg is no longer checked, advertised, or installed**: markitai has never supported audio or video, yet `doctor` presented FFmpeg as "audio/video file processing" and the installers offered to fetch it

### Fixed

- **The OpenAI-family defaults refreshed to the current generation**: `gpt-5.6-luna` replaces `gpt-5.4-nano` at $0.20/$1.20 against $0.20/$1.25. A stale default only fails once the model starts refusing, so a guard test now fails when any default comes within 120 days of the retirement date litellm records
- **Azure OpenAI deployments get the `api_version` they configure**: `litellm_params` declared no such field and unknown keys are ignored, so the documented Azure example had it dropped on parse and never reached litellm
- **A PDF converted with `--ocr` arrives as pages again**: both OCR paths joined pages with a bare blank line and screenshot-only emitted a marker spelling no reader matched, so an OCR'd document reached LLM batching, the drift guard and output profiles as one undivided run of text
- **The document whose LLM call failed keeps the same layout as the rest**: every failure path returned before the pipeline's profile step, leaving one file in a `--profile` run with the default asset layout
- **`--llm-batch` explains itself when it refuses `--ocr`**: page images travel inside the document's own request, and the batch converts with the LLM off first — the branch that reads scanned pages with local OCR rather than rendering them
- **`--llm` did nothing without a config file**: the step that fills the model pool from `MODEL` or a detected key was gated on the config's own `llm.enabled` and ran before `--preset` and `--llm` were applied
- **`--resume` could not resume an interruption**: the CLI batch path never wrote the base state file the loader needs, so an interrupted run left a delta sidecar nothing could replay and paid for every document again
- **`--llm-batch-collect` honours `--config-json`**: it built its configuration without the inline overrides, so a collect run's live fallback used whatever pool the config file named
- **Batched requests to reasoning models stopped failing outright**: OpenAI's batch deployments reject function tools while reasoning is on, so every document 400'd and fell through to a live re-run. Requests now carry `reasoning_effort="none"` where the model is reasoning-capable and the request uses tools
- **`router_settings.fallbacks` actually works**: deployments were addressed directly by id, so litellm never saw a group to fall back from. A configuration naming no `default` group now fails at startup instead
- **Claude models no longer cost $0 in the usage report**: litellm answers with zero prices for a name its table lacks, which read as "free" and hid the entry a fuzzy match would have found. Relatedly, `gpt-5.4-codex` was priced as plain `gpt-5.4`
- **Truncated LLM responses are counted in the cost report**: a response cut off at the token limit was discarded before its usage was recorded, so the most expensive calls were the ones missing from the totals
- **Improving a prompt now actually changes the output**: the persistent cache was keyed on a call's category rather than the prompt, so a document converted before a prompt change kept serving the old result
- **A failed LLM call can no longer leave a document permanently blank**: an empty result from every retry was written to a cache with no expiry, so the document "converted" to nothing on every future run
- **A finished conversion can no longer report failure**: onnxruntime's teardown at interpreter shutdown occasionally aborts the process, turning a conversion that had already written its output into a non-zero exit
- **`--ocr` without the OCR extra no longer reports success**: it fell back to an image placeholder and exited 0, so the file "converted" with nothing read from it
- **Install hints name commands that work**: extras names were eaten as rich markup, and `pip install` / `uv add` act on the current project rather than markitai's isolated environment. One helper now renders the command and reads `sys.prefix`, so a pipx install is told about pipx and a `uv tool` install about `uv tool`
- **The wheel now carries `LICENSE` and `NOTICE`**: `license-files` named a path that does not exist inside the package directory, so every published wheel shipped without a licence
- **Six extraction gaps against defuddle 0.19.3**: article text inside dismissible `aria-hidden` overlays, CodeMirror code blocks, mid-article image rows, Substack Notes, SVG figures and inline related-story blocks. The resync also fixed what it newly exposed — Hugo admonitions, lightbox duplication, LaTeX image services, `<noscript>` fallbacks and line-numbered code
- **Reddit, Hacker News and YouTube pages are quality-checked again**: their gate was registered under a profile name the extractors never emit, so all three fell through to the generic-article check
- **Embedded PDF images survive symlinked and out-of-tree output directories**: pymupdf4llm may write paths symlink-resolved or relative to the working directory, and only one spelling was being rewritten
- **CMYK JPEGs no longer fail image compression**: images from print-sourced PDFs reached a path handling only RGBA, P and LA, and were dropped
- **The screenshot viewport settings finally do something**: `screenshot.viewport_width` and `viewport_height` were declared, described and published in the schema, but no code read them
- **Two settings that looked configurable never were**: `auto_proxy` and the screenshot `full_page` flag were read with a `getattr` default although no config model declares either
- **`NO_PROXY` is honoured on every fetch path**: the unified resolver had no callers at all, and the Playwright launch, both Cloudflare paths and the batch renderer resolved a proxy without consulting the exception list — the system list on macOS and Windows included
- **Proxy auto-detection no longer invents a proxy that isn't there**: it probed common local ports for a TCP connection, which succeeds for every port under a TUN-mode VPN
- **`markitai --help` opened on the Batch API**: the `--llm-batch` flags belonged to no panel, and ungrouped options render first. The examples also offered a YouTube conversion that has never existed
- **The installer asks about mirrors only when the default index is actually slow**, rather than warning every user without a proxy — someone in Frankfurt met a question about China mirrors as their first impression
- **A "no" to OCR is now respected by the installer**: suggestions were merged back into the selection, so declining it still installed it
- **The test suite is hermetic to the developer's own configuration**: a real `~/.markitai/config.json` or `.env` used to fail parts of the suite on the machine of anyone who actually uses markitai
- **Mobile conversion uses one compact source card**: the URL area sits above a shared Options/upload/Convert action row instead of three stacked controls, with 44px touch targets and a naturally wrapping mobile CLI preview. Desktop retains an inline composer.
- **The composer actions share one lightweight style**: Options, file upload and Convert are borderless, evenly padded controls with the same hover and focus treatment; Convert stays the clear primary through heavier ink and a light accent wash rather than a filled box.
- **The options panel is grouped instead of listed**: the preset leads as the primary row (with its adjusted status and hint), Enhance collects LLM, OCR and image analysis, Output holds the profile, and the URL/file fetch selectors, source switches and cache/compression toggles fold into an Advanced section that opens automatically when one of them is already non-default. Every control, hint, linkage rule and translation is unchanged.
- **Presets and conversion options stay linked** across the panel, API request and CLI preview, using server-provided preset definitions. Selecting a preset resets its five features, dependent image analysis pauses and restores with LLM/plain mode, and screenshot source and remote backends resolve consistently. CLI previews default to concise preset-plus-deviation commands using the server preset map. A visible default-config assumption and “Include config overrides” option preserve access to explicit off flags for screenshot-only, pure, cache and compression when local configuration differs.

### Security

- **`markitai serve` now issues an access token**: the startup banner prints sign-in URLs and requests from other machines must present it, replacing the old unauthenticated partial access with a 401
- **`markitai serve` can no longer be steered into the network it runs on**: with `--host 0.0.0.0` any LAN machine could submit a URL and have the server fetch it, private addresses and cloud metadata endpoints included
- **Binding beyond loopback now says what that means**: `--host 0.0.0.0` warns that anyone who can reach the server may convert files and read, download or delete the entire conversion history
- **`fetch.remote_consent=ask` now asks before X/Twitter enrichment too**: that path went remote without prompting, honouring only a decision made earlier

## [0.23.0] - 2026-07-18

### Added

- **Export any web-workspace preview to PDF**: the rendered Markdown prints to a clean A4 document — real four-side margins, whole code blocks and figures that never clip mid-page, and repeating table headers. A "PDF settings" menu holds an optional custom header/footer (on by default); PDFs always print light so the result is identical in Chrome, Safari and macOS Preview

### Changed

- **The web workspace is now usable on phones and narrow windows**: a single ≤780px layout gives the composer, options and task list one coherent column — the header collapses to identity plus history/settings, language and theme move into the settings dialog, external links and notifications dock to the bottom, and the batch download sits under the task list
- **Batch download moved next to the conversion options** on desktop, so it no longer competes with the Clear action in the workspace header

### Fixed

- **The local server now refuses cross-origin and rebinding requests**: a Host/Origin allow-list (loopback, IP-literal hosts, and any `--allowed-host` you pass) blocks a malicious web page from reaching the API — which could otherwise read saved provider credentials or drive server-side URL fetches — while same-origin use and LAN binds keep working
- **In-place retry and LLM enhancement are reliable**: retrying an item while its siblings are still converting no longer strands it as "queued"; a failed enhancement keeps the working base result instead of downgrading the row to an output-less error; an interrupted rerun no longer erases the whole job from history on restart; and re-runs overwrite their own prior outputs instead of accumulating versioned duplicates or serving a stale enhanced variant
- **Scanned-document OCR stays accurate across a batch**: the sparse-page tiled fallback no longer lowers detection thresholds process-wide, so later pages are OCR'd at full confidence
- **LLM alt text applies to images whose names contain spaces or CJK**: references written percent-encoded were not being matched, so captions were silently dropped for those assets
- **Quoted posts from X keep their exact text**: an interior ellipsis or "show more" run inside the quote no longer fabricates a truncation marker on complete text
- **Editing only a provider's API key no longer pins its default API base**: the editor field is empty (with the default shown as a placeholder) when the connection uses the provider default, so saving keeps tracking that default
- **Whole-history downloads clean up after themselves**: the generated archive is removed once the download finishes and can no longer survive as an orphan, and a file deleted mid-build is skipped instead of failing the download
- **The completion notification reads "N done" for a clean job** instead of "N done · 0 failed", and the local server's job finalization no longer blocks other jobs' live progress while sizing large output directories

## [0.22.0] - 2026-07-14

### Added

- **`markitai serve` adds a local web workspace for conversion**: install the `serve` extra to upload files or folders, submit URLs, watch live progress, preview and download results, and revisit seven days of on-disk history from a bilingual, accessible interface
- **LLM setup moves into the web workspace**: discover available local and API-backed providers, browse live model lists, configure weighted deployments, test connections without exposing stored credentials, and use the same settings for conversion jobs
- **Web jobs gain recovery and comparison tools**: retry failed file or URL items, filter large result sets, receive background completion notifications, copy an equivalent CLI command, and compare the base Markdown with its LLM-enhanced variant

### Fixed

- **PDFs with spaces or parentheses in the filename now get embedded-image analysis**: pymupdf4llm sanitizes the source name when writing extracted images (`My Paper.pdf` → `My_Paper.pdf-0001-00.jpg`), but embedded images were collected by globbing on the raw input name, so `--alt`/`--desc`/`rich` silently skipped every embedded image while page screenshots kept working. Collection now resolves the image refs written into the Markdown, keeps the previous prefix match as a fallback, and warns when a referenced asset is missing from disk
- **Web result downloads work with nested artifacts on Windows**: API paths use URL separators instead of filesystem backslashes, so images and other generated assets open through the same links on every supported OS

## [0.21.1] - 2026-07-12

### Fixed

- **Fresh installs on macOS and Windows no longer try to compile litellm from source**: litellm 1.92.0 shipped Linux-only wheels, so `uv tool install markitai` on other platforms fell back to building its new Rust extension from the sdist — failing outright without a Rust toolchain, or with a wall of pyo3 errors when the build environment picked an unsupported Python (e.g. a system-default 3.14). That release is excluded; dependency resolution lands on a version with wheels for every supported platform

## [0.21.0] - 2026-07-12

### Changed

- **Legacy `.xls` files now convert in pure Python** (xlrd via MarkItDown, same engine as `.xlsx`): no Office application or LibreOffice is launched or required, on any platform. Cell content is identical to the previous Excel-automation output (verified live); conversion is also faster and no longer serialized behind an app lock
- **The persistent LLM cache is now scoped to your model pool**: switching model configuration stops serving results produced by the old models, while rotating an API key keeps every hit; document cleanups also keep hitting after a file is renamed (identical content, different name). Existing cache entries miss once after upgrading — the old entries were unreachable anyway (see Fixed)
- **Structured LLM calls now go through the full transport retry loop** (exponential backoff, quota/billing short-circuit, empty-response retry) that plain-text calls always had; they previously bypassed it entirely. With a persistently degenerate model the worst-case attempt count is accordingly higher — that is the cost of actually retrying
- **Standalone `.urls` batches gain vision enhancement** in the `--screenshot` multi-source corner, matching what a single-URL conversion of the same page produces
- **Internal: the fetch, LLM, and CLI subsystems were restructured** behind unchanged behavior — machine-enforced import-layering contracts now run in CI, fetch.py shrank from ~3000 to ~1100 lines with per-strategy modules, the LLM pipeline is a single engine instead of five hand-rolled copies, and report/exit-code/output handling is single-sourced across all input paths. A 43-item regression matrix over every 0.15–0.20 fix verified nothing regressed

### Removed

- **Python 3.14 support**: `requires-python` narrows to `>=3.11,<3.14` across the package and installers, and the CI/publish matrices no longer test 3.14. The platform-conditional ONNX Runtime constraint that existed only to keep 3.14 resolvable is gone with it
- Excel COM automation (Windows) and Excel AppleScript automation (macOS), together with the `.xls` entries in the batch pre-conversion and heavy-task paths — `.xls` no longer needs them

### Fixed

- **The cross-session LLM cache never actually hit**: the persistent cache's reads and writes disagreed on the cache key's model column, so no run ever saw a previous run's results — every rerun of an already-processed document paid the full LLM cost again. Reads and writes now agree (locked by a regression test), and reprocessing an unchanged document is near-instant and free
- **macOS `.doc`/`.ppt` conversion via Microsoft Office was broken end to end**: Word's and PowerPoint's AppleScript `open` returns nothing, so the script's document binding was never established — the first reference died, the error handler's own reference to the same variable masked the real error behind an inscrutable "variable openedItem is not defined", the document was never closed, and the stranded zombie documents degraded the app further with every retry. The script now binds the document by its unique staged name, closes it under both its pre- and post-save names, and always propagates the original error. Excel's "Parameter error -50" had the same root and is fixed the same way (now moot for `.xls` — see Removed — but the fix also covers the PPTX-to-PDF export path)
- **macOS: `.doc`/`.ppt` conversion failing on an Office app's first scripted launch after an Office update** ("the document never registered" / PowerPoint error -9074). In that state the app silently drops Word's parametered `open` request while answering everything else; Word's script now retries with a plain `open` mid-poll (verified to penetrate and heal the state) and logs the recovery. Error messages for the stall and for -9074 now carry the verified remedy — open the app manually once so it finishes first-run setup — instead of the misleading "app stuck or overloaded, quit and retry"
- **Truncated or degenerate LLM output no longer poisons the cache**: screenshot extraction and URL enhancement now reject length-truncated responses like every other call site, and URL enhancement no longer caches output whose degenerate tail had to be cut
- **`markitai -I` no longer crashes with a raw traceback when a config file is invalid**: the interactive wizard now reports the same actionable message as every other command
- **Directory-batch reports no longer drop screenshot counts for URL entries**
- **The defuddle HTTP client now rebuilds when proxy or timeout settings change** (it previously kept the first client for the whole process, like jina always did correctly)
- **Disabled models (`weight: 0`) no longer affect cache scoping**: disabling a model stops serving its old cached results, and adding or removing a disabled entry no longer invalidates the pool's cache
- **Copilot authentication status reads correctly with current Copilot CLIs**: newer CLI versions write JSONC-style comments and renamed the login key, which made `doctor` and `auth copilot status` report a parse error as "not logged in". Both formats are now accepted, an unparseable config reports as indeterminate rather than unauthenticated, and a login the CLI itself reports as successful is never vetoed by the follow-up config read

## [0.20.0] - 2026-07-10

### Added

- **macOS can use installed Microsoft Office when LibreOffice is absent**: legacy `.doc`, `.ppt`, and `.xls` files are converted through Word, PowerPoint, or Excel via AppleScript, and PowerPoint can export PPTX slides to PDF for rendering. The fallback is enabled by `office.macos_fallback`, can be disabled for headless sessions, and reports one-time Automation permission requirements through `doctor` and the documentation

### Changed

- **Remote fetching keeps public URLs frictionless while tightening privacy**: public URLs may use remote fallbacks without confirmation, with one process-wide stderr notice covering defuddle.md, Jina, Cloudflare, FxTwitter, and Twitter oEmbed; private, local, DNS-resolved non-global, and credential-bearing URLs (including sensitive path tokens) remain local, while `MARKITAI_NO_REMOTE_FETCH=1` blocks every remote path, including an explicit remote `-s`
- **`doctor` reports capability health instead of package presence**: normal checks fail only for RapidOCR and configured workflows; Playwright is verified by launching Chromium, active model environment references are checked, and a requested `--fix` only installs and rechecks Chromium without changing project dependencies
- **`markitai init` now preserves existing configuration by default**: pressing Enter selects Keep, while Update and Overwrite remain explicit choices
- **Onboarding starts with the portable installer**: the homepage detects Windows versus macOS or Linux before first paint and recommends `setup.ps1` or `setup.sh`, keeps `uv tool install markitai` as a manual option, includes a 60-second no-LLM example, and improves Chinese navigation plus screen-reader and high-contrast support
- **Copilot pricing metadata recognizes `gpt-5.6-luna` when explicitly configured**: generally available models remain the automatic OpenAI and ChatGPT onboarding defaults while the limited-preview model stays opt-in

### Fixed

- **Quiet mode is consistent across single and batch work**: Markdown requested on stdout is preserved, errors stay on stderr, quiet dry runs omit previews, partial URL batches keep successful outputs and exit 10, and informational progress or success paths remain hidden
- **Image conversions with no enabled extraction path no longer report success**: a standalone image without `--ocr` or `--llm` now exits 1 with an actionable message instead of producing no output with a successful status
- **Installer reruns preserve intent**: the shell and PowerShell setup scripts skip `markitai init --yes` when `~/.markitai/config.json` already exists, preserve existing extras, and honor an explicit `MARKITAI_VERSION` even when Markitai is already installed
- **Homepage quick-start commands remain readable in light mode**: the dark command panel now consistently uses light text and transparent code backgrounds, stacks before commands become cramped, and serves a real `/favicon.ico` instead of returning 404
- **Python 3.14 dependency resolution avoids an incompatible ONNX Runtime pin**: platform-aware constraints keep Magika's Windows cap where required while allowing supported ONNX Runtime releases elsewhere

### Security

- **Configuration output hides secrets by default**: `markitai config list` recursively redacts secrets and custom header values, reduces `api_base` values to their origin, and only reveals original values when `--show-secrets` is explicitly passed
- **URL credentials stay local and out of diagnostics**: userinfo, sensitive path tokens, query strings, and fragments are removed from terminal errors, progress labels, dry-run previews, console and file logs, and generated output names; hostnames resolving to any non-global address cannot cross a remote dispatch boundary
- **macOS Office automation isolates untrusted documents**: the fallback disables macros and external-link updates while opening read-only staged copies, binds and closes only the exact document it opened, serializes app access across processes, and keeps recoverable staging files private
- **Headless setup never implies consent to optional software**: without a usable terminal, the portable installer installs only uv, Python, and Markitai unless `MARKITAI_INSTALL_OPTIONAL=1` explicitly enables optional packages, browser binaries, system dependencies, and third-party CLIs

## [0.19.0] - 2026-07-10

### Changed

- **Remote extraction no longer prompts by default** (`fetch.remote_consent` default `ask` → `always`): public URLs fall back to remote extraction services (defuddle.md, Jina, Cloudflare — tried one at a time, only after local strategies fail) without an interactive confirmation; the first use is disclosed via an INFO log. Private/local URLs never use remote services regardless of this setting, and URLs carrying credentials in the netloc (`user:pass@host`) are now treated as private too. Set `fetch.remote_consent=ask`/`never` or `MARKITAI_NO_REMOTE_FETCH=1` to restore prompting or disable remote services
- **Consent prompt rewording** (for `remote_consent=ask`): the prompt now explains why it appears (local extraction didn't succeed), that services are tried one at a time (first success wins), and dynamically lists only the services actually in the chain — Cloudflare (which runs against your own account credentials) only appears when configured. Interactive prompts also pause the live progress display instead of tearing it

### Added

- **Live progress checklist (StageList)**: multi-stage live progress for single-URL and single-file conversions — completed stages persist as `✓ Fetched via fxtwitter (2.1s)` lines, and the active stage shows a spinner with an elapsed-time suffix. Stdout-mode conversions (no `-o`) finally show progress; they were previously fully silent through fetch + LLM enhancement

### Fixed

- **`--resume` was a no-op**: the CLI batch entry point accepted the flag but always reprocessed every file from scratch. It now correctly loads saved state — completed files are skipped, failed/interrupted files are retried, newly-discovered files are picked up — and reports `Resuming batch: N completed, M remaining`
- **Output naming reverted to the append scheme**: `sample.pdf` → `sample.pdf.md` (not `sample.md`), undoing the 0.15.0 extension-replacement change, which hid the source format, mangled multi-suffix names, and made single-file and batch conversions of the same file disagree
- **Windows install one-liner 404**: the website now serves `setup.ps1` (docs pointed to https://markitai.dev/setup.ps1 but only setup.sh was deployed); Chinese changelog edits now trigger site redeploys
- **Prompt REMINDER leaked into cleaned output**: with smaller models (observed with `gpt-5.4-mini`), the vision-cleaning prompt's trailing `REMINDER: ...` instruction — and its `---` delimiter — could be echoed verbatim at the end of `.llm.md` output. The prompt now delimits the document with `<document>` tags and puts all instructions before the content, and a new output guard strips echoed prompt fragments, including from previously cached results
- **Image alt text was silently skipped for some URL conversions**: URLs with a screenshot but no multi-source content (e.g. X posts via site extractors) fell through to text-only LLM processing without image analysis, and the URL-batch path never analyzed images at all — `--alt`/`--desc` had no effect there. Both paths now analyze downloaded images (alt text + `images.json`). The stdout asset rewrite also no longer overwrites LLM-generated alt text with the bare filename
- **Batch image analysis no longer trips over bare-payload JSON**: small models sometimes answer a single-image batch with the bare item instead of the `{"images": [...]}` wrapper; this burned Instructor retries and fell back to per-image analysis with an ERROR log. The JSON repair layer now coerces such shapes in place, so the batch succeeds directly
- **Weak models could mangle social-post bodies during LLM cleanup** (flattened quoted-post blockquotes, respaced CJK text — observed with `claude-agent/haiku`): content profiled as `social_post` now passes its body through verbatim and the LLM only generates metadata. For all other document types, the document-processing prompt gained explicit blockquote-preservation and CJK-spacing rules
- **ChatGPT connection errors were non-retryable and unreadable**: httpx transport failures (connection reset/refused, timeouts) were mapped to a non-retryable `ProviderError` with an empty message, bypassing every retry layer. They are now marked retryable and carry the underlying error text
- **Console log lines no longer tear the live progress display**: log output now routes through the shared rich stderr console, so lines print above the StageList spinner instead of leaving stale frames behind; quiet/stdout mode also applies the same third-party retry-noise filter as normal mode (raw instructor retry errors previously leaked through)
- **Failed LLM enhancement is now visible in the output**: when every LLM path fails, the fallback `.llm.md` frontmatter carries `llm_enhanced: false` and an ERROR-level log is emitted — previously the only hint of degraded output was an empty description

### Removed

- **Legacy progress facilities retired**: internal `ConversionStatus`, `ProgressReporter`, and `OutputManager` are replaced by StageList; `markitai.utils`/`markitai.cli` no longer export `ProgressReporter`, and `attempt_login()` lost its unused `output_manager` parameter
- **Dead code sweep**: unreachable async enricher registry, unused exception hierarchy, deprecated no-caller helpers, test-only utility functions, and ~5MB of unreferenced test fixtures; `markitdown` dependency narrowed from `[all]` to the office extras actually used (drops azure/audio/pdfminer/youtube transitive deps); `httpx` and `lxml` are now declared directly

## [0.18.0] - 2026-07-09

### Changed

- **Web extraction parity with Defuddle**: main-content selection and noise-pattern removal now closely port Defuddle's algorithms (scoring, content patterns, content-boundary detection). Benchmark corpus mean vs. the Defuddle ground truth: 91.04 → 92.72

## [0.17.0] - 2026-07-08

### Removed

- **Gemini CLI provider** (`gemini-cli/`) — Google retired the underlying OAuth onboarding. Use a direct `GEMINI_API_KEY` or route through OpenRouter instead

### Added

- `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN` auth support, checked ahead of `GH_TOKEN`/`GITHUB_TOKEN`
- Elapsed-time indicator on slow conversion stages, so a long-running LLM call doesn't look hung

### Fixed

- **Cloudflare fetch now respects site-specific extractors**: switched from the `/markdown` to the `/content` endpoint so Cloudflare-routed pages get the same extraction quality as every other strategy
- Reduced console log noise from duplicate retry/validation messages

### Changed

- Local providers no longer waste tokens on unused extended-thinking/reasoning output
- Provider detection and `init` now suggest cheaper default models

## [0.16.0] - 2026-07-07

### Added

- **Bilibili opus extractor** for `bilibili.com/opus/<id>` posts
- **Anti-bot/CAPTCHA detection**: challenge pages (Geetest, Cloudflare, reCAPTCHA, hCaptcha) are now recognized instead of silently treated as real content

### Changed

- **X/Twitter extraction is DOM-first again**, falling back to the FxTwitter/oEmbed enricher only when native extraction comes up short

### Fixed

- X Article URL matching, fetch performance, and frontmatter word-count bugs

## [0.15.0] - 2026-07-04

Maintenance overhaul: dependency refresh, Python 3.14 support, and a multi-round audit fixing 30+ verified bugs across batch processing, fetch/cache, LLM providers, image handling, and configuration.

### Added

- Python 3.14 support; MIT License added to package metadata
- Grouped, faster `--help` via rich-click
- Garbled/scanned-text detection for PDFs, with an advisory suggesting `--ocr`
- Repeated header/footer suppression across PDF pages
- VLM degeneration guard (truncates repetition-loop vision/OCR output)
- HTML extraction and footnote-handling parity with Defuddle (MathJax/MathML, code blocks, footnotes across many site types)
- Unified `-s/--strategy` fetch flag (old per-backend flags kept as deprecated aliases)
- **Remote-fetch consent**: URLs are no longer sent to third-party services without consent (`fetch.remote_consent`, `MARKITAI_NO_REMOTE_FETCH`)
- PDF hidden-text sanitization (prompt-injection guard): `security.pdf_sanitize`
- Per-page OCR routing for mixed digital/scanned documents
- Conversion-quality benchmark harness against a Defuddle ground-truth corpus
- Release automation via release-please

### Fixed

Selected highlights from a multi-round quality and bug-hunt pass:

- X/Twitter DOM extractor rebuilt for X's 2026 markup redesign; FxTwitter fallback now actually reachable from the default fetch chain
- `.eml` email support (native), HEIC/HEIF/AVIF image input (`markitai[heif]`), quality guardrails gate for CI
- `markitai init` merges into an existing config instead of overwriting it; clearer login-failure guidance across providers
- Fetch/cache correctness: stale AUTO-strategy cache revalidation, Playwright context leaks, proxy auto-detection false positives, null URLs crashing batches
- LLM/provider correctness: failures no longer silently reported as success, vision cache poisoning, Copilot concurrent temp-file races, event-loop stalls from blocking calls, retry backoff holding concurrency slots
- Image/conversion correctness: EXIF orientation, LA-mode transparency, uncompressed-image naming, EMF/WMF mislabeling, OCR engine config drift, temp-directory leaks
- Config/CLI correctness: config editor validates before save, symlink safety check fixed, `llm.concurrency` lower bound enforced, JSON log formatting, `config set` type coercion and bracket-notation support

### Changed

- Mixing an input path with a subcommand is now an error instead of silently dropping the input
- `-o out.md` on a single file/URL writes exactly that file
- Diagnostics moved to stderr so piped stdout output stays clean
- Output naming switched to an extension-replacement scheme (`sample.pdf` → `sample.md`) — **reverted in 0.19.0**
- `image.stdout_persist` now defaults on
- Reports (`.markitai/reports/`) are batch-only by default
- Dependency refresh (litellm, opencv-python, playwright, instructor, and others)
