"""Deterministic process exit for short-lived markitai processes.

Every markitai process loads onnxruntime, whether or not it will ever run a
model: markitdown's ``_stream_info`` imports Magika for content sniffing, and
Magika imports onnxruntime eagerly. Converting a plain ``.txt`` file pays for
it too.

onnxruntime's C++ statics are torn down after Python is finished, and under
load that teardown can abort the process:

    libc++abi: terminating due to uncaught exception of type
    std::__1::system_error: recursive_mutex lock failed: Invalid argument

The output has already been written by then, so the visible damage is exit
code 134 on a conversion that in fact succeeded — a false failure for any
script or CI job that checks the status. Nothing on the Python side can make
a third-party library's static destructors safe; what markitai can do is stop
reaching them once its own work is done.

Confirmed by keeping onnxruntime out of the import graph: the abort, which
appeared 3-12 times per full parallel test run, disappeared entirely across
three runs.
