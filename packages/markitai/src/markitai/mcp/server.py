"""markitai MCP server: document and URL conversion as agent tools.

A thin stdio MCP server over the public Python API (``markitai.aconvert``),
built on the official MCP SDK's high-level server (``MCPServer``, the API
formerly named FastMCP). One long-lived event loop serves all requests, which
is exactly the safe path the markitai API documents for embedding.

Design notes:

* Every conversion writes real files (caller-supplied ``output_dir`` or a
  fresh temp directory), so large results never need to travel through the
  model context: the inline markdown is truncated past a threshold and the
  caller reads the written file instead.
* ``batch_convert`` runs in-process as a background asyncio task with an
  in-memory job table — no persistence, jobs vanish with the server.
* LLM enhancement is opt-in per call: ``llm`` defaults to None, which follows
  the server's own markitai config (``llm.enabled``, off by default), so an
  explicit ``llm=false`` is the only way to force it off. An absent model
  never breaks a call that did not ask for enhancement; it only fails the
  calls whose config or arguments turned it on. Models resolve as in the
  CLI (config, then ``MODEL``, then provider-key auto-detection).
* ``main`` loads ``./.env`` then ``~/.markitai/.env`` like the CLI does, so
  ``markitai-mcp`` and ``markitai mcp`` see the same keys.
