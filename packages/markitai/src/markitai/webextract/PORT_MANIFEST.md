# defuddle port manifest

`markitai.webextract` is a Python port of
[defuddle](https://github.com/kepano/defuddle) (TypeScript, MIT © kepano).
This manifest records which upstream sources the port tracks and the upstream
commit the parity corpus is pinned to, so corpus and algorithm resync from one
place.

Pinned upstream commit: `a332b4d5d539066ddfe19fc4ef6f1b6ffaf914b8`

The pin must match `tests/defuddle_fixtures/VERSION` (enforced by
`tests/unit/webextract/test_port_manifest.py`; both files are rewritten by
`scripts/sync_defuddle_fixtures.sh`). `.github/workflows/defuddle-watch.yml`
opens an issue when upstream cuts a release ahead of this pin.

## Known gaps vs upstream 0.19.3 (audited 2026-08-25)

The corpus is synced to release 0.19.3
(`a332b4d5d539066ddfe19fc4ef6f1b6ffaf914b8`) and all 208 fixtures pass the
parity quality tests. The 6 porting gaps found by the first resync attempt
(aria-hidden overlay articles, CodeMirror code blocks, mid-article image
rows, Substack note permalinks, SVG external-CSS fallbacks, inline
related-stories blocks) are ported, as are the SVG CSS-variable /
`light-dark()` / Tailwind color resolution passes, noscript lazy-image
resolution, lightbox image dedup, line-number gutter handling, and
LaTeX-image-service conversion the full-corpus benchmark surfaced.
Remaining known gaps:

- Fixtures for sites where markitai has its own richer extractors
  (Reddit, Hacker News) intentionally diverge from defuddle's expected
  output; they score low in the benchmark but are held by its per-fixture
  guardrail floors, not by parity.

## Local source comparison (2026-09-13)

A build-and-run comparison against defuddle
`a0984a817518565cedd0f89423c85cfff9e8ba45` found additional behavior gaps despite
the passing quality floors: collapsed Obsidian callouts, hidden-content retry
selection, arbitrary Tailwind variants, and Hacker News comment permalinks.
These are now covered by focused regressions. The corpus pin above is unchanged;
passing quality tests does not mean byte-identical Markdown or complete parity.

The audit also adopted a dedicated known-HTML conversion path and cheap selector
checks before subtree protection scans. Reproducible comparison scripts live in
`scripts/benchmarks/`. Remaining differences include CLI startup cost, unsupported
stdin HTML input, and intentional Markdown differences in richer extractors.
