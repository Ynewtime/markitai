"""Unified LLM call engine.

This module is the single transport layer for LLM calls. It provides two
entry points:

- ``complete_text``: plain text completions with the full transport retry
  loop (backoff, quota short-circuit, empty response retry) and per-attempt
  usage accounting.
- ``complete_structured``: structured (instructor-based) calls with
  two-layer cache lookup, transport retries, instructor validation retries,
  the structured-mode staircase, length checking, usage accounting, and
  cache write-back.

Both entry points share one retry loop (``_acompletion_with_retries``);
``LLMProcessor._call_llm_with_retry`` delegates here since Phase 2.3.

Structured calls run a capability-tiered staircase (``run_structured_ladder``)
whose rungs come from ``markitai.llm.structured``: the most native mode the
model pool supports first, one rung down per failure, ending at ``MD_JSON``.
JSON repair exists only on that last rung — every rung above it has the
provider, not the model, producing the JSON.

This module must not import ``markitai.llm.processor`` (circular import:
processor -> document -> engine).

        The two call modes differ on exactly three axes, expressed as
        parameters:

        - ``own_semaphore``: when True (text calls), each attempt acquires
          the engine semaphore and backoff sleeps happen OUTSIDE it —
          sleeping while holding a slot would freeze the whole pool during
          a rate-limit burst. When False (instructor adapter), no slot is
          acquired here: the caller (``complete_structured``) holds one for
          the whole structured call, so backoff sleeps keep it.
        - ``usage_context``: when not None (text calls), every successful
          attempt is recorded via ``track_usage``. None for the instructor
          adapter: usage is tracked once per structured call from the final
          raw response, which instructor accumulates across its own retries.
        - ``finalize``: maps the successful raw response (plus derived
          model/tokens/cost) to the return value; None returns the raw
          ModelResponse (instructor needs the raw object).

        ``budget_context`` names the document context whose request budget
        every attempt spends from; the budget check runs before each
        attempt, so a tripped context stops retrying without issuing more
        requests.
