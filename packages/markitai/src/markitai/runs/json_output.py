"""Machine-readable run result for ``markitai --json``.

The CLI's four conversion paths already collect one :class:`Outcome` per work
item for ``--record-history``. This module renders that same collection as a
single JSON document on stdout, so a script or agent can read
``{source, status, output, error, cost_usd}`` without parsing Rich panels or
hunting for the batch report file.

The module holds no process state: the CLI's own ``--json`` flag decides
whether the envelope is emitted, and every function here is pure. That keeps
one source of truth for "is JSON mode on" and makes the renderers trivial to
test.

This module sits below :mod:`markitai.cli` and must never import it (the
import-layer contracts in the root ``pyproject.toml`` make that direction
forbidden); the CLI imports this module, never the other way round.
