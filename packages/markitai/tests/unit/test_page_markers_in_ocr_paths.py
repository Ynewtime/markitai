"""A PDF converted with --ocr still arrives as pages.

The standard PDF path splits into `page_chunks` and writes a marker before
each page. Both OCR paths joined their pages with a bare blank line, so an
OCR'd document reached every later stage as one undivided run of text:

* `llm/content.py` splits a document into batches by page marker; with none
  it falls back to character counting, so a batch can cut mid-page.
* `llm/document.py` skips its structural-drift protection entirely for a
  document it reads as having no pages.
* `output_profiles` rewrites markers to `<!-- page: N -->` for publication;
  it had nothing to rewrite.

None of this failed loudly, because a document with no pages at all — a
`.txt`, a web page — is a legitimate case that looks exactly the same.

These run the real converter over the real fixture; a mocked pymupdf4llm
would only confirm that the mock returns what it was told to.
