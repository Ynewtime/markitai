# Working in the markitai codebase

A uv workspace: the published package lives in `packages/markitai` (source in `packages/markitai/src/markitai/`), the VitePress docs site in `website/` (bun), install scripts in `scripts/`. Python 3.11–3.13.

```bash
uv sync --all-extras                              # install workspace + extras
uv run pre-commit install                         # ruff on commit
uv run pre-commit install --hook-type pre-push    # pyright + tests on push
```

## Gates: a change is done only when every one passes

```bash
uv run pytest -q                                 # default selection: parallel, excludes slow/network
uv run ruff check && uv run ruff format          # lint + format (rules: E,W,F,I,B,C4,UP,ARG,SIM)
uv run pyright packages/markitai/src packages/markitai/tests   # 0 errors required, same scope as CI
uv run lint-imports                              # architecture layering contracts, 0 broken required
uv run bandit -c pyproject.toml -r packages/markitai/src -q   # security lint
```

CI runs the same five over `packages/markitai/src` and `packages/markitai/tests`. Frontend dependencies use tracked `bun.lock` files; install with `--frozen-lockfile`.

For webapp or documentation changes, also run:

```bash
bun install --cwd webapp --frozen-lockfile
bun run --cwd webapp test
bun run --cwd webapp lint
bun run --cwd webapp typecheck
bun run --cwd webapp check:css
scripts/sync_webapp_static.sh --check             # use --sync first when app assets changed
bun install --cwd website --frozen-lockfile
bun run --cwd website docs:build
```

Treat `website/guide`, `website/zh/guide`, `skills/`, and CLI `--help` as one documentation surface. `test_website_docs_sync.py` checks option coverage, removed flags, extras, and bilingual links; you still have to compare descriptions and defaults against the code yourself. Keep Unreleased changelog entries concise and synchronized between languages. Generated website changelogs and installer copies come from the root files during docs builds.

For public CLI changes, inspect the matching step in `scripts/e2e_release_check.sh`: its checks must match current CLI output (serve sign-in URLs use `#token=`). The full script uses real provider keys and incurs charges; use targeted local checks for presentation-only changes and keep an existing E2E report as historical evidence.

Opt-in markers: `uv run pytest -m "slow or network"`; `parity` marks defuddle-parity tests. CI runs the default selection plus an isolated built-wheel install smoke test on Linux/macOS/Windows × Python 3.11–3.13; a failure on one platform only is still a real failure.

Run the CLI from source with `uv run markitai <input>`.

## Conventions

- Match surrounding code style; ruff and pyright must stay clean.
- Logging is loguru with `{}` formatting: `logger.info("x={}", x)`, never printf-style `%s`.
- Google-style docstrings; English comments.
- Every bug fix ships with a regression test.
- Conventional Commits keep history and changelog writing easy (releases themselves are tag-driven; see the `markitai-release` skill).

## Extraction-quality benchmark

`packages/markitai/benchmarks/` scores the HTML→Markdown pipeline against the defuddle ground-truth corpus in `tests/defuddle_fixtures/` (rapidfuzz block alignment, 0–100 per fixture). It measures continuous quality drift, complementing the pass/fail parity tests. Run it before **and** after any extraction change:

```bash
uv run python packages/markitai/benchmarks/webextract_quality.py
```

It prints per-fixture deltas against the committed `benchmarks/results/baseline.json` and writes `benchmarks/results/latest.json` (gitignored). An intentional quality change gets a deliberate `--update-baseline`; an unintentional delta is a regression to fix. The full-corpus run is manual/CI-cron only; `tests/unit/test_webextract_quality_benchmark.py` smoke-tests the scorer math. `scorer.score_with_llm_judge` is an opt-in LiteLLM judge (content/structure/noise, 0–100): a cache miss needs an explicit `model` and `allow_network=True`, there are no retries or heuristic fallbacks, and the default runner never calls it.

## Syncing the defuddle fixture corpus

`scripts/sync_defuddle_fixtures.sh /path/to/defuddle-clone` copies upstream defuddle's `tests/fixtures/*.html` + `tests/expected/*.md` into `tests/defuddle_fixtures/` and records the source commit in `VERSION`. Both the parity tests and the benchmark read this corpus, so resync only as a deliberate act: expect scores to shift, and re-baseline afterwards.
